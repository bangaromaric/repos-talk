MyGabon is a small demo application based on modern Android application tech-stacks with Hilt and MVVM architecture.<br>This project focuses in Dependency injection, that is a technique widely used in programming and well suited to Android development. By following the principles of dependency injection, you lay the groundwork for a good app architecture.<br>
Also fetching data from the network with an API via repository pattern.
